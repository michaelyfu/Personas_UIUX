					<h1>Overview</h1>	
					<hr style = "background-color:#5CB8E4; height:1px;"/>
					<p>
			    	The Sci Li phone charging station is located in the basement of the Sci Li and allows students to charge their phones while studying. The charging station is similar to a locker rental. There are 8 phone charging units that students can use for any period of time. These stations are kept secure by users setting their own passcodes for their units.
			    	</p>
			    	<br>
			    	Problem/Solution: Many students require their phone to be charged and/or remove distractions.
			    	</p> 
			    	<br>
			    	The Sci Li phone charging station solves these problems by 1) providing students with a public, secure phone charger and 2) removing their phones from potentially distracting them during study sessions.

			    	<img src="./components/empathyMap1.png" class="empathyMap" alt="Unprepared Ulysses Empathy Map">
			    	<p>Unprepared Ulysses is a 1st year Computer Science student at Brown University that is addicted to video games. A self-proclaimed "God of Gaming," he spends most of his day playing Valorant with his friends on Discord. With a midterm coming up for his Data Structures course and no lectures attended, Ulysses is trying to cram the night before the exam.</p>
			    	<p>Ulysses represents a CS student at Brown that has to cram for a midterm the next day since he hasn't been going to lecture and reviewing the material. However, Ulysses is easily distracted and wants to seek a distraction-free zone. He typically does homework in his room, but inevitably results in him aimlessly scrolling through TikTok or playing Valorant. Ulysses tries going to the Sci Li after hearing about the charging booth from a friend to remove his phone as a distraction. Many students like Ulysses will only use the interface when they want to fully focus on their work.</p>

			    	<p>Consistent Connie is another 1st year Computer Science student at Brown University that packs everything onto her Notion, inputs assignments into her Google Calendar on the first day of classes, and holds leadership positions in 3 different clubs on campus (as a freshman).</p>
			    	<br>
			    	<p>Connie represents a CS student at Brown that one may describe as the archetypal "good student." She wakes up at 7 am every morning for her yoga class, and hits the Sci Li after classes end ~3 pm each day. Since she is so busy and starts her mornings so early, she uses Notion and Google Calendar on her phone to help keep track of her day. However, she notices that her phone always seems to dip below 20% battery charge in the later afternoons. So, she uses the Sci Li phone charger booth to charge her phone, but also remove distractions so she can focus on school assignments. When first coming to charge her phone, Connie clicked the "help" button to figure out how to use the machine. However, no information popped up, and she thought the machine was broken. She only began using the device after seeing someone else use the machine.</p>
